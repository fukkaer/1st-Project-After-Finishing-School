# 1st-Project-After-Finishing-School
Was trying to tackle some simple projects on my own after finishing all my courses. Made Jan. 2022
- V.1 was made in a day, some time in the first week of 2022.
- V.1 , prints pie at start, as it was a project. Includes floor tile cost calculation, Counting of change that should be given, and unit conversion between imperial and metric.
- V.1 notes: Exception handling was added. NOT FUNCTIONAL 
- V.1.1 notes: Removed printing of pi. Turned it into a comment. NOT FUNCTIONAL
- V.1.2 change Notes: Program semi-functional. converting fahrenheit to kelvin doesn't work. exiting sub functions not functioning. Added coin flip.
